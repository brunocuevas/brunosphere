A classic that will never dissapear is the '7 things you have to do to ____' .. and fill the gap. 
Maybe become more productive, healthier, or wealthier. There is a gradient of styles here:
from purely clickbait-AI-generated entries to youtubers that will tell you their secret to
study 80 hours per week. The mantra of most videos is that you have to organize your life,
promote self-discipline and follow life-recipes as if you were a robot. Wake up at 5AM. Make 
a break in your sleep at 3AM. Drink water. Write a diary. Meditate half an hour. Notion.
Obsidian.  Among all these tips, I wonder: where are *the other people*? Are these tips only for people 
living alone? For people living with other productivity nerds? Or just for those who live
with extremely patient people?

This post is about the oposite: improving your life by collaborating with other people.
A few months ago, while I watched *The Bear* in Hulu (one of my favourite shows from
last year), I thought: wouldn't it be amazing to join other people to cook? I made a few
searches on the internet, and then I came up with quite an attractive idea: starting
a food co-operative.


**What is a meal cooperative?** The idea of the food-cooperative that we carry out 
is to *share your cooking with other people*. On a normal week, I make dinner 4 times. 
Therefore, I have to come up with 4 different meals, organize my groceries, and spend 
around 40 minutes per day just chopping vegetables and stirring the stw. In the 
*meal-coop*, I only cook one day. Instead of preparing 4 meals in a week, I make 
4 meals in a single day, using the same recipe and ingredients. Once I finish cooking, 
I put the resulting food in some glass containers, and I exchange it for some other meals 
with my friends.


**What are the advantages?**

- *scale*. It's usually easier to cook a little bit more quantity than preparing more
meals (however, this rule has its own exceptions and bounds).
- *time*. I think I save around 2 hours per week when I coordinate.
- *taste*. My game is boring. But if you combine it with other people, is not that boring.
- *community*. We are a group of friends connected through food. Isn't that beautiful?
From time to time we organize a dinner together, and otherwise we might just chat on the lobby
while we exchange containers.

**What do I do with the extra time?**

I thought at the begining to start making body building exercises or improving my meditation
skills. But in the end I just do my normal routine after a whole day of work: maybe watch
TV, work a little bit more, or read a book.

**Tips**

- Buy good containers
- Be reasonable. Nobody is expecting you to cook a steak. But people will get angry if you just
make white rice.
- Try to find friends that live very closeby (that means, 5 mins bike)
- Be chill. Many days, we have plans in the evenings and we cannot cook. It's alright, we just
try to coordinate.
- Have a whatsapp-signal-messenger-tiktok-telegram or whatever you use on your daily 
communications.
- Make a list of allergies and disliked foods. This can be the most challenging part. So far,
we did not have any challenges, but those might arise in the future with newer people.
- And have fun cooking!
