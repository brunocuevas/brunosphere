# Wellcome to the Brunosphere! 

![My profile picture](/images/profilePic.png)

## Who is Bruno?

Hi! My name is Bruno Cuevas. I am a post-doctoral researcher in the University
of Wisconsin-Madison. Previously I completed my higher education in the Universitat
Autonoma de Barcelona and in the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. In the last one,
I obtained a Margarita Salas fellowship in the 2021 that funds my current position
at the UW-Madison.

My main topic of research are the **Origin of Life** and the **evolution of protein structure**. 
I carry out computational research with an special emphasis on 
the study of molecular dynamics and biological-chemical networks.


## What can I find here?


In this blog, I will talk about my current field of research —**origins of life**— technical stuff 
that might help someone, and maybe about some of my favorite non-work related topics (politics, 
urbanism, climate change, cinema).

## What is your goal in life?

Being awesome. I would alsolike to have a cargo bike and an industrial apartment. 

## How is a day in your life?

I wake up, I drink coffee again and again, and then I go to sleep. Sometimes I might have a beer
before going to bed.


## Why a blog?

I left most social networks before the pandemic. I kept using Twitter until it was bought
by some clown that turned everything into pieces. But I still wish to communicate some of my
ideas.

I think that blogs offer the right balance between being able to communicate what is
going on with your life.
