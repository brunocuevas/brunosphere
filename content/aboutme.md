# Wellcome to the Brunosphere! 

![My profile picture](images/profilePic.png)

I am a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, at the great lab of Prof. 
Betül Kaçar. I obtained last year a Margarita Salas fellowship to carry out my research activity 
in the United States. Our focus is on the evolution of Early Life.

I am a fully computational researcher, and my main specialties are theoretical chemistry, machine 
learning, molecular dynamics, and (recently) network analysis. I obtained my Ph.D. at the 
Universidad Politécnica de Madrid in 2021 by creating a method to
predict electron densities using machine learning.

Though this might give the feeling that I am a computational chemistry expert,  I argue that I'm 
actually more of a multidisciplinary researcher with some Python skills. I enjoy acknowledging my 
ignorance and trying to branch out my skills rather than being very deep in one field. Is this a 
good trait or a perk? I guess time will say.


# What can I find here?


In this blog, I will talk about my current field of research —**origins of life**— technical stuff 
that might help someone, and maybe about some of my favorite non-work related topics (politics, 
urbanism, climate change, cinema).

# Why to open a blog?

Right? Why should I write brainy blog posts instead of just uploading stories? There are
two main reasons:
- **I want to improve my writing**. Thinking is a fundamental activity, but it rarely solves any 
trouble if it is not followed by action. Writing is one of these actions. I want to develop
my ideas through the elaboration of blog posts.
- **Last year's Musk's purchase of Twitter** made me reconsider whether we should keep using social
media to share our thoughts and lives. I believe that the internet is a great place, but our lazy 
reliance on Big Tech companies has made us dependent and influenceable. Luckily, it is not too late 
for us. We can open blogs like this one for free. 

I hope that someone finds this blog enjoyable!
