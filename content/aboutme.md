My name is Bruno Cuevas-Zuviría, and this is my blog. I have recently left the
last social network I had (Twitter), and since then I feel much more productive...
no. It's actually the same. But I think that there are certain things that I'd
like to shout out, and I also aim to improve my writing.


**Who is Bruno?**


I am a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, at the great
lab of the proffesor Betül Kaçar. I obtained last year a Margarita Salas fellowship
to carry out my research activity in the United States. Our main focus is around the
evolution of Early Life.

I am a fully computational researcher, and my main specialities are theoretical chemistry,
machine learning, molecular dynamics and (recently) network analysis. I obtained my
PhD in the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid in 2021 by creating a method to
predict electron densities using machine-learning.


Though this might give the feeling that I am a computation expert I argue that I'm actually more a multidisciplinar
researcher with some Python skills. I enjoy more on acknowledging my own ignorance and
trying to branch my skills than about being very deep in one field. Is this a
good trait or a perk? I guess time will say.


**What can I find here?**


In this blog I will talk about my current field of research —**origins of life**—
technical stuff that might help someone, and maybe about some of my favourite
not-work related topics (politics, urbanism, climate change, cinema).
