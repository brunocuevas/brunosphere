# My family when I was 9

A few days ago my parents rescued these pictures from some burnt CD.
It's a great finding. Because we started relying on digital photography
since 2001, and we were pretty messy regarding the back-ups of our
data, we have ended up loosing most pictures of my childhood. I haven't
seen a picture of how I looked like back then in at least 5 years!
